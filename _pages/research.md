## Research Themes

### 🌾 Crop Engineering & Synthetic Biology
We engineer novel traits through gene editing and synthetic regulatory circuits.

### 🧠 AI in Biology
Developing predictive models for genotype-to-phenotype mapping and phenotypic plasticity.

### 📸 High-Throughput Phenomics
Building pipelines for image-based trait analysis, field robotics, and multi-modal sensing.

### 🌍 GxPxE Modeling
Studying how genetic and environmental variables interact in shaping complex traits.

### 🎓 Training Future Scientists
We actively mentor students in interdisciplinary thinking, data literacy, and leadership.
