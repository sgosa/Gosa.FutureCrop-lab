## About FutureCrop Lab

FutureCrop Lab is an interdisciplinary research group dedicated to advancing the frontiers of plant science through the fusion of **genetics and breeding, crop physiology, developmental biology, synthetic biology, high-throughput phenotyping, and AI**. 

We aim to:
- Design crops for future climates
- Understand genotype-phenotype-environment (GxPxE) interactions
- Leverage AI to accelerate discovery
- Train the next generation of scientific leaders

FutureCrop Lab is led by independent researcher Dr. SG and fosters a collaborative and inclusive environment, embracing data-driven science to solve agricultural challenges.
